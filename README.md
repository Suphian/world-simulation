# World Simulation

A browser-based simulation that displays an interactive world map and allows experimental game mechanics.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Start a local web server in the project root:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
3. Open [http://localhost:8000/index.html](http://localhost:8000/index.html) in your browser.

Opening the HTML file directly from the filesystem may prevent scripts or assets from loading, so make sure to use a local server as described above.

## Project Structure

```

## Description

The aim is to experiment with map-driven gameplay where the world reacts to player input. This repository will eventually include the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript needed to render the map and power the simulation.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests for new features or fixes.
